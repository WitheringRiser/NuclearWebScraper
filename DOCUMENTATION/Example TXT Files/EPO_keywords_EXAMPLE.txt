* This file should be formatted as follows:
*	One (or several if using the "+" method) phrases per line.
*	Needs to be lower case
*	The end of each line should be a single space followed by 1 (to denote primary) or 2 (to denote secondary)
*	Spaces can exist within each keyword phrase
*	If you want to make sure that certain keywords appear together, combine these keyword phrases with a "+" 
*	in between, with no spaces on either side of the plus sign.
*		Ex: remote+in situ 1 would mean that the keyword phrase "remote" and the keyword phrase "in situ"
*		appearing anywhere inside the patent would register as a single primary keyword match.
