By optimizing the degree to which water is accelerated through a venturi device, the amount of power that an energy device extracts from the ocean is maximized. Prior venturi-based wave energy devices have proven to be inefficient because of the relatively small amount of power that they generate relative to their size and cost. By optimizing the venturi effect created within the submerged venturi components of such devices, the speed of the water moving through the narrowest portions of such a devices is maximized with respect to the wave environments in which they operate, and a maximal amount of energy is extracted from the ocean. This optimization of a wave energy device's power is sufficient to render such devices cost effective. The method of extracting energy from the accelerated flow of water moving through such venturi devices is not limited, and many alternatives exist, each with its own potential benefits.

An apparatus and method is characterized by providing an optical transfer function between a predetermined illuminated surface pattern, such as a street light pattern, and a predetermined energy distribution pattern of a light source, such as that from an LED. A lens is formed having a shape defined by the optical transfer function. The optical transfer function is derived by generating an energy distribution pattern using the predetermined energy distribution pattern of the light source. Then the projection of the energy distribution pattern onto the illuminated surface is generated. The projection is then compared to the predetermined illuminated surface pattern to determine if it acceptably matches. The process continues reiteratively until an acceptable match is achieved. Alternatively, the lens shape is numerically or analytically determined by a functional relationship between the shape and the predetermined illuminated surface pattern and predetermined energy distribution pattern of a light source as inputs.

A fixed/variable hybrid system has modified constant flow open center hydraulic valves ("fixed/variable valves"), including an open center core, spools, a power core, and a tank galley. A small fixed displacement pump provides fluid at a constant rate to the open center core. A variable displacement piston pump provides fluid directly to the power core as needed. Activation of spools partially restricts the open center core causing an increase in fluid pressure that is communicated to the variable displacement piston pump's load sense signal port, causing the pump to increase fluid flow and pressure to the power core. Activated spools direct pressurized fluid from the power core to the applications through selected hydraulic ports. Activated spools also direct fluid flow from selected hydraulic ports via the tank galley to a hydraulic tank. Pumping the majority of fluid only on an as-needed basis results in significant efficiencies.

The “FLAT TERMO-SOLAR COLLECTOR AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS”, subject of this patent, represents a radical paradigm shift, both in the manufacturing process—whose steps were minimized and subject to any degree of automation—and regarding the shape design of the solar energy gathering tubes and tightness of the metal housing that houses the collecting element. The solar energy gathering tubes in accordance with this patent are manufactured with copper and have reduced costs—as the materials, shapes and manufacturing process—due to three innovative embodiments: 1. The reducing the thickness of the copper plates to only 0.10 to 0.15 millimeters, which reduces the cost of materials and the final weight of the assembly; 2. The molding of the gathering tubes by its stamping in these thin plates, which provide structural stability to the thin plates, thereby balancing the brittleness of their low thickness with increased resistance conferred by stamping; 3. Automatic welding process through high precision and low cost laser or electrical discharge, eliminating the electrodes or manual welding, two symmetrically stamped plates, so getting through a single automatic operation a whole hermetically sealed system of tubes for water flow and solar energy gathering in a single manufacturing operation. Besides this, radical costs reduction arising from the industrial design outlined above, by changing the geometry of solar collector tubes, that tend to have low internal volumes and elliptical shapes, oval, or any non-circular shape, whose largest diameters are positioned facing the sun to receive solar radiation which increase the useful area of solar energy absorption by the gathering tubes.

Membrane Device for Water and Energy Exchange
US2020009500A1 • 2020-01-09 • MOLECULE WORKS INC [US]
Earliest priority: 2018-07-05 • Earliest publication: 2020-01-09
A device for exchange of water molecule and temperature between two fluids. The device comprises thin molecular sieve membrane sheets that allow water molecules to permeate through while blocking cross-over of the exchanging fluids. The device provides two sets of flow channels having a hydraulic diameter ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 mm for respective process and sweep fluid flows. The two sets of the channels are separated by a membrane sheet having a thickness less than 200 *m. The thin molecule sieve membrane may be prepared by forming an ultra-thin zeolite membrane layer on a porous metal-based support sheet which provides very high water permeance so that the exchange can be conducted in a compact membrane module at high throughput. The device can be used to remove water from a process stream of higher water content by use of a sweep fluid of lower water content or higher water affinity. For example, the device can be used to condition outdoor fresh air close to the temperature and humidity of indoor air by conducting humidity and heat exchange between the fresh air flow drawn from outdoors and waste air discharged indoors.

The invention discloses a shock absorber for a gear-shifting guide shaft assembly. The shock absorber comprises a shock absorber left cover, a shock absorber right cover and a torsion shock absorber check ring which are sequentially arranged from left to right. At least three cylindrical helical springs which are evenly distributed in the circumferential direction are installed in installation cavities correspondingly formed in the shock absorber right cover through pre-tightening force. The shock absorber left cover and the torsion shock absorber check ring are buckled together through clamping buckles and clamping grooves. The outer diameter of the cylindrical helical springs is larger than the depth of the installation cavities, and therefore when left cavities and right cavities rotate relative to the installation cavities, the side walls of the left cavities and the side walls of the right cavities can compress the cylindrical helical springs. Spline teeth are arranged on the right side of the shock absorber right cover and used for being connected with a gear-shifting guide shaft worm wheel. Internal teeth are arranged on the left side of the shock absorber left cover and used for being meshed with a gear-shifting worm wheel shaft gear. When external teeth of the gear-shifting worm wheel shaft gear are worn, clearance generated by wear can be automatically compensated for, and therefore zero-clearance meshing between the gear-shifting worm wheel shaft gear and a gear-shifting lever is achieved.

Turbine section (26) vane ring (44, 46) swallowing capacity, or throat cross section is selectively varied, through use of bi-cast vanes (50). The bi-cast vanes share a common, prefabricated vane airfoil profile (52), as well as subsequently cast outer diameter/upper (54) and inner diameter/lower vane (56) platforms. Throat cross section (T) between pairs of opposed vane airfoils (52) is selectively varied, prior to vane casting, by changing orientation of the prefabricated airfoil within corresponding vane platform molds (60). Vane ring (44, 46) swallowing capacity is readily adjusted, to meet ambient air pressure operating conditions at different plant altitudes, or different fuel caloric content properties (e.g., natural gas or coal gas). Airfoil (52) orientation is varied locally about the vane ring (44, 46), to adjust for local variances in combustion gas mass-flow or flow direction caused by locally varying physical constraints within the engine (20).

A clutch assembly includes a fluid-actuated piston that allows clutch usage in both high pressure and low pressure applications. The configuration of the clutch assembly allows the piston to be used with different seal arrangements. These different seal configurations create differently sized piston surface areas against which the inlet pressure will act to drive the piston. The ability to change the size of the affected piston surface areas allows for the piston to receive essentially the same driving force under both high pressure and low pressure applications. Thus, the clutch assembly enables use of high hydraulic pressure (e.g., 320 psi) in combination with a seal arrangement that creates a small piston-driving surface area, and also use of low pneumatic pressure (e.g., 120 psi) with a seal arrangement that creates a large piston-driving surface area.

Where a relationship between maximum heat release rate timing (¸dQpeak) and a first combustion period length (aref) (that is, a reference relationship) in the case where an engine rotation speed (NE) of a spark-ignition internal combustion engine is a selected speed (NEO) and a valve opening characteristic of an intake valve is a reference characteristic is expressed by the function aref = f(¸dQpeak), when the valve opening characteristic of the intake valve changes to a specific characteristic from this state, a first combustion period length (a) for selected maximum heat release rate timing (¸2) is estimated on the basis of the mathematical expression a = f(¸2) + ”a1.
